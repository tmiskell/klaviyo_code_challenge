"""
    Purpose:  A python script designed to send out a personalized email to each email address within a given subscriber list.
              For each recipient:
               (1) The script fetches the current weather for that recipient's location 
               (2) Changes the subject of the email based upon the weather.  
                (a) If it's nice outside, either sunny or 5 degrees warmer than the average temperature for that location at that
                    time of year, the email's subject will be "It's nice out! Enjoy a discount on us."  
                (b) If it's not so nice out, either precipitating or 5 degrees cooler than the average temperature, the subject
                    will be "Not so nice out? That's okay, enjoy a discount on us."
                (c) If the weather doesn't meet either of the previous conditions, it's an average weather and the email subject
                    will simply read "Enjoy a discount on us."
              In all cases: 
               (1) The email will be sent to the recipient's entered email address 
               (2) Come from the author's email address.
             
              For each email, the body of the email will contain:
               (1) A readable version of the recipient's location
               (2) The current temperature and weather. Ex: "55 degrees, sunny."
               (3) An image or animated GIF of the current weather.

              Leverages the Aeris API to retrieve each recipient's weather by their location.
